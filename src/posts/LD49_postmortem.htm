<title>LD49 Postmortem</title>
<p>
  <a class="link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmortem">Apparently 'postmortem' is one word.</a> However, other official-seeming sources treat it as two words, or with a hyphen. Either way, I'm going to use 'postmortem' as it spares me one character of typing. Ironically, researching its spelling and writing all this will have the opposite effect. Huh.
