    <h1>Third!</h1>
    <h3>September, 2021</h3>
    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
      This should've been the first post, but I was too excited to write about optimizing particles to do that. Hopefully I can be forgiven for this grave transgression.
    </p>
    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>
      Someone that has been learning graphics since 2019.
    </p>
    <h2>What will this blog be about?</h2>
    <p>
      Graphics and graphics accessories.
    </p>
    <h2>What <i>won't</i> this blog be about?</h2>
    <p>
      My boring life, I sincerely hope.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
    <p>
      Graphics programmers probably. I will probably make many wild assumptions of knowledge in my posts (I know I have already). I will try my best to provide links to resources to learn about the things I speak of. It will also keep me from making BS claims. When I inevitably make some wack claims, feel free to contact me on GitHub and I will rectify them.
    </p>
    <h2>How did you make this website?</h2>
    <p>
      With raw HTML and CSS. I'm using Visual Studio Code to edit. The site is hosted on GitHub using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" class="link">GitHub pages</a>. Raw HTML and CSS becomes too annoying to deal with, I guess I'll have to use a static site generator and get branded with a watermark. I'm pretty happy with the current situation currently. The repository for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/JuanDiegoMontoya/JuanDiegoMontoya.github.io" class="link">here</a>.
